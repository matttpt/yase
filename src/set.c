/*
 * A prime set uses linked lists of buckets, which can contain up to a
 * fixed number (BUCKET_PRIMES) of sieving primes.  There is a list for
 * every segment to be sieved, an array of lists of small sieving primes
 * (categorized by next wheel_idx) to be processed specially, a list of
 * inactive primes whose first segment to mark has not yet been reached,
 * and a list of finished primes which no longer have multiples on the
 * interval.  By placing primes into lists associated with the segment
 * of their next multiple, the overhead of having many sieivng primes
 * with no multiples on a segment is greatly reduced.  This idea comes
 * from Tom√°s Oliveira e Silva.  The algorithm is described at
 * http://sweet.ua.pt/tos/software/prime_sieve.html.
 *
 * There are also a bunch of inline prime set/bucket routines in yase.h,
 * so make sure to check those out too.
 *
 * The logic in prime_set_add() assumes that primes are added IN ORDER,
 * so be careful!  (This assumption makes it a lot easier to create the
 * list of inactive primes, which must be sorted so that the first prime
 * to activate is first, etc.)  Currently, this is not a problem, as
 * sieve_seed() discovers and submits the sieving primes in order.
 *
 * It is also important to note that when a prime is submitted to the
 * set, it is assumed that the next_byte of the prime is in absolute
 * terms, i.e. if one massive, unsegmented sieving bit array were used.
